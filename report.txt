Recommendations Expansion:

Note: All my code can be found in the expansion package, and my CSV file is "data/math.csv".

1. I did my expansion based on the file about Math results.

2. To convert the file into scala readable CSV, I used a combination of Python and Excel.
   a. I used a method in Excel called replace all to convert nominal to numerical values, then exported it to type .csv.
   b. While copying to scala, it was putting all the values in double quotes (""), so I used Python to
      replace all double quotes with empty string.
   c. These are 2 of my references for converting into numerical values, for different columns:
      yes - 1
      no - 0

      other - 0
      mother - 1
      father - 2

3. For reading the CSV file, I used the same code as what was provided to us.
   The only change I made to my topK method was sorting values from map based on their absolute value.

4. My method returns top 6 values with the highest magnitude of correlation with the input property.

5. These are 3 of my results for different properties:
   a. G3 => List(G2, G1, failures, Medu, higher, age)

   b.Pstatus => List(famsize, absences, Medu, guardian, activities, nursery)

   c.address => List(traveltime, school, internet, age, Medu, G2)
